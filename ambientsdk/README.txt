This directory is generated by extracting the AAR file for the Ambient SDK.

Steps to upgrade to a new Ambient SDK from the AAR file:
    1. unzip -d ambientsdk ambientsdk-release.aar
    2. cp ambientsdk/res/* ./resources/res/
    3. cp ambientsdk/classes.jar

** If the Ambient SDK ever expands to include JNI libs or assets, you'll need to copy those too,
   and possibly tweak the target definition in swe_browser_apk.gypi.
